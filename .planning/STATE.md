## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v6.0]: Audience shell separation first -- layout shells before any page content to prevent rework
- [v6.0]: SEO no-URL-changes contract -- never add /consumer/ or /pro/ prefixes to indexed paths
- [v6.0]: Personalization deferred from launchpad -- ship Phase 31 with national views, add DB-linked personalization later
- [v6.0]: PDF via @react-pdf/renderer (not Puppeteer) -- confirmed serverless-safe, React 19 compatible
- [v6.0]: Per-user daily report limit required before shipping Phase 32 -- cost control prerequisite
- [v5.0]: Call Report service_charge_income stored in thousands -- multiply by 1000
- [v4.2]: Report template design is locked -- do not redesign, just fill with data

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 32 pre-planning]: @react-pdf/renderer primitive system differs from Tailwind -- Recharts SVGs cannot render inside PDF; need chart-to-PNG strategy before Phase 32 implementation
- [Phase 29 pre-planning]: Anonymous search gate location not yet confirmed -- verify exact mechanism before Phase 29 planning
