# Studio Matrix — the 25 report institutions

Selected 2026-08-15 from the 30 coverage-viable institutions (≥9 of 15 featured
categories in `published_fee_catalog`; see `coverage.sql`). Districts 1 (Boston),
3 (Philadelphia), 8 (St. Louis) have no viable institutions yet — matrix covers the
9 districts where data is rich. All institutions are community-tier: the exact
segment that lacks analytics staff and cares most about local fee position.

Dropped from the 30: Academic FCU, O&R Utilities FCU, New Covenant Dominion FCU
(NY district-2 overweight / closed-membership), F R B FCU (Fed Board employees —
closed membership), Angelina Savings (district-11 overweight, lowest coverage).

**Data-quality follow-ups for the pipeline:**
- 7192 and 8485 institution names appear mislabeled in institution_sources.
- Redwood Capital Bank (1675): suspicious $50 ATM fee datapoint (50x median) — verify against source document.
- Bank of the Pacific (860) appendix shows contradictory duplicate lines: "Notary $0.00 FREE" AND "Notary service $10.00" — likely one is notary-for-customers vs general; needs dedupe/labeling rule in Darwin/Hamilton. Audit other institutions for same pattern.
- 860 "Maximum overdraft/NSF fee $384.00 · daily" reads like an extraction error — it is the daily cap (12 × $32); frequency/terms phrasing should say "daily maximum" for cap-type lines.
- Registry names can arrive fully uppercase (FIDELITY BANK) — display-layer title-casing added in fill.mjs 2026-08-15; fix casing at source when convenient.
