# Data Hygiene Audit

Run a data quality audit against the current Fee Insight Postgres model.

## What This Skill Does

Use current `src/lib/data-store/*` queries or direct read-only SQL to identify data quality issues. Product/report fee reads must use `published_fee_catalog`; pipeline diagnostics may inspect `raw_fee_observations`, `verified_fee_observations`, `published_fee_records`, and the agent run ledger.

## Steps

1. Read current data through `src/lib/data-store/connection.ts` or existing `src/lib/data-store/*` helpers.
2. Check institution coverage, source coverage, fee publication coverage, agent backlog, stale runs, and provider/circuit state.
3. Present findings with row counts, examples, and the owner agent for each fix.
4. Route operational fixes through visible `agent_runs` work instead of one-off scripts.

## Checks

| Check | Source | Healthy Target |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Invalid state codes | `institution_sources.state_code` | 0 institutions |
| Source URL gaps | `institution_sources.website_url`, `institution_sources.fee_schedule_url` | Trending down |
| Published fee coverage | `published_fee_catalog` | Trending up |
| Raw-to-verified conversion | `raw_fee_observations`, `verified_fee_observations` | Backlog shrinking |
| Agent run health | `agent_runs`, `agent_run_steps`, `agent_run_events` | No silent queued/running runs |
| Provider/circuit health | `automation_control`, `ai_api_usage_events` | Blocked reasons visible |
| Missing financial data | `institution_financial_records` joined to `institution_sources` | Trending down |

## Useful Read-Only SQL

```sql
SELECT state_code, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM institution_sources
WHERE state_code NOT IN ('AL','AK','AZ','AR','CA','CO','CT','DE','DC','FL','GA','HI','ID','IL','IN','IA','KS','KY','LA','ME','MD','MA','MI','MN','MS','MO','MT','NE','NV','NH','NJ','NM','NY','NC','ND','OH','OK','OR','PA','RI','SC','SD','TN','TX','UT','VT','VA','WA','WV','WI','WY','PR','VI','GU','AS')
AND state_code IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY state_code;

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS institutions,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE website_url IS NOT NULL AND btrim(website_url) <> '') AS with_website,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE fee_schedule_url IS NOT NULL AND btrim(fee_schedule_url) <> '') AS with_fee_url
FROM institution_sources;

SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM agent_runs
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT institution_id) AS institutions_with_published_fees,
       COUNT(*) AS published_observations
FROM published_fee_catalog;
```

## Output Format

```md
| Check | Result | Status | Owner |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Source URL gaps | 1,234 | WARN | Magellan |
| PDF pending OCR | 456 | WARN | Rosetta |
| Low-confidence raw rows | 78 | REVIEW | Knox/Darwin |
