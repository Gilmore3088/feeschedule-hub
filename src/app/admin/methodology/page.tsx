          Bank Fee Index is the national benchmark for banking fee data, tracking{" "}
          {COVERAGE_STATS.categories} fee categories across {COVERAGE_STATS.institutions}{" "}
          financial institutions. Our mission is to make fee intelligence transparent, accurate,
          and actionable — for consumers who pay these fees, for institutions that set them, and
          for analysts who study them.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          This document explains how the index works: where the data comes from, how fees are
          extracted and categorized, how we score our own confidence in each observation, and
          where the data has gaps. The goal is not to provide a replication guide, but to give
          any data user enough context to trust — or appropriately discount — the numbers they see.
        </p>
        <Callout>
          Data users should treat this index as a benchmark based on published fee schedules, not
          as a guarantee of the fees any individual customer will actually pay. Promotional rates,
          relationship pricing, and waiver programs are not captured here.

          Institution coverage begins with the regulatory registries maintained by the Federal
          Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration
          (NCUA). These APIs provide the authoritative list of insured depository institutions
          in the United States — approximately 4,500 banks and 4,800 credit unions — including
          asset size, charter type, Federal Reserve district assignment, and primary website URL.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          From this foundation, we identify the fee schedule for each institution: typically a
          PDF, HTML page, or downloadable document published on the institution&apos;s public website.
          Fee schedules are the primary source of record. We do not use estimated or third-party
          fee data — every observation in the index traces to a specific document at a specific URL,
          crawled at a specific date.

        <p className="mb-3">
          Fee schedule discovery is a two-stage process. First, we attempt deterministic URL
          discovery: checking known URL patterns common to banking websites (e.g.,
          <code className="mx-1 px-1 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 rounded text-xs">/fees</code>,
          <code className="mx-1 px-1 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 rounded text-xs">/rates-and-fees</code>),
          parsing sitemaps, and following links from the institution&apos;s homepage. This succeeds
          for the majority of institutions with well-structured websites.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          For institutions where deterministic discovery fails, we deploy an AI-assisted
          discovery agent using Claude to reason about likely URL patterns and page structures.
          A Playwright browser automation layer handles JavaScript-rendered pages — a growing
          segment of fee schedule delivery, particularly among larger institutions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Once a fee schedule document is located, it is downloaded and processed through one
          of two extraction pathways: direct HTML parsing for web pages, or pdfplumber-based
          text extraction for PDF documents. The extracted text is passed to Claude with a
          structured extraction schema specifying the {COVERAGE_STATS.categories} fee categories
          the index tracks.

        <p className="mb-3">
          Every extracted fee receives an extraction confidence score in the range [0.0, 1.0].
          This score reflects the model&apos;s certainty that the identified value correctly
          represents the fee as published — accounting for document clarity, context specificity,
          and the absence of ambiguities such as conditional pricing or range values.

          are automatically staged for inclusion in the index. Approximately{" "}
          {COVERAGE_STATS.autoStageRate} of extracted fees meet this threshold. The remaining{" "}
          {COVERAGE_STATS.humanReviewRate} enter a human review queue where a trained analyst
          reviews the extraction against the source document before approving or rejecting.
        </p>
        <Callout>
          The confidence threshold is a precision-recall trade-off. At 0.85, we accept that some
          valid fees are held for human review (lower recall) in exchange for high certainty in
          the auto-staged population (high precision). For index computation purposes, staged
          and approved fees are treated equivalently.

            Extracted fees that deviate more than 3 standard deviations from the category median
            are flagged for human review regardless of confidence score. This catches parsing
            errors where a fee amount is plausible in isolation but anomalous in context (e.g.,
            a $500 monthly maintenance fee).
